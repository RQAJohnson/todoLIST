## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine 
for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
```
Spring Boot Framework, 
Java, 
Postman, 
Selenium, 
Maven (although does come within Spring Boot Framework. But it's always good to have for work on other Java projects).
```
### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
Say what the step will be
```
Give the example
```
And repeat
```
until finished
```
End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
